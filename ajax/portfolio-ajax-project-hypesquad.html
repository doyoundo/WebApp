	  <p>
          Hype Squad is a fast-paced, close-quarters combat multiplayer game. Using unique weapon combinations, a team of 3 players 
        need to survive till the end.
        <br/>
          As a project manager and RL engineer, I conducted the modification of the game source code to connect game environment and GCP (RL training environment). 
        Multi-agents reinforcement learning(MARL) method was implemented. The result validated the top winning set out of 13,000 combinations of 
        chips(passive enhancement), weapons, and different skills. Also, the agents learned extraordinary plays - such as draggig out the game until timeout when
        currently equipped combination is weak or hide until their skills are not on cooldown. 
        To optimize the process and the result, transfer learning and curriculum learning methods were testsed as well.
