	  <p>
      Hype Squad is an adrenaline-fueled, close-quarters combat multiplayer game where a team of 3 players must strategically wield unique weapon combinations to survive until the end.

      In my role as an AI project manager, I oversaw the modification of the game's source code, bridging the game environment with Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for RL (Reinforcement Learning) training. Implementing Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) techniques, we identified the most effective set from a pool of 13,000 combinations encompassing chips (passive enhancements), weapons, and various skills.
      
      The outcome not only validated the top-winning combination but also witnessed agents learning exceptional tactics, such as prolonging the game until timeout when the current combination is weak or strategically hiding until their skills are off cooldown.
      
      To optimize both the process and results, we experimented with transfer learning and curriculum learning methods.
